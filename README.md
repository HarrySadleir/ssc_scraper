# SSC Scraper
A repository to scrape and analyze public SSC data for use in an INFO 200 research assignment. 

# Components
- ssc_scraper.py: Uses Selenium to navigate between pages of the ssc and collect data from the tables. It stores the data in JSON files, which can be much more easily analyzed and visualized later on.
- More to come: Currently planning to use [some nice R visualizations](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.tree/vignettes/data.tree.html#plotting) and possibly scrape some more data to quantify the ssc data.
